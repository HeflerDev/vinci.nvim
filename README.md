## Surge0n Theme for Neovim

**Surge0n** is a focused, green-based Neovim colorscheme inspired by the discipline of surgeons. It was designed for developers who spend long hours operating on code with calm intensity and steady precision. Every shade serves a purposeâ€”from the sterile greens of the interface to the vivid red of an error, evoking the urgency of blood on the table.

This theme doesn't shout. It informs. It doesn't decorate. It prepares the environment for deep, uninterrupted work.

### âœ¨ Features

- **Surgical green palette**: Muted greens for comfort, subtle contrast for navigation, and sharp red for critical feedback.
- **Tree-sitter support**: Full compatibility with modern syntax highlighting across languages.
- **Deliberate contrast**: Everything is tuned for readability, even over hours of work.
- **Plugin integration**: Looks great with `nvim-tree`, `telescope.nvim`, `cmp`, `lualine`, and others.

### ðŸ§  Philosophy

Surge0n is more than a themeâ€”itâ€™s a discipline. Built around the mindset of a surgeon, itâ€™s designed for those who work through long coding sessions with precision and calm. The green tones echo the sterile focus of an operating room, where every detail matters, and distractions are fatal to flow.

But accidents happen. When red appearsâ€”an error, a warningâ€”itâ€™s not just a color, itâ€™s blood. A vital signal that something needs attention. And just like a skilled surgeon, youâ€™ll fix itâ€”clean, focused, and unfazed.

Surge0n isnâ€™t about decoration. Itâ€™s about staying sharp when it matters.
